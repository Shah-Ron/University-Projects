### AIM

To create a webapp that will provide an alternative solutions for the busroutes that are conjusted or blocked by the construction in Christchurch, New Zealand.

### Explaination

The data for the constructions happening in Christchurch, New Zealand was collected from Christchurch City Council and the data for the Bus routes were collected from the Christchurch Metro.
We used these data to create an interactive map for showing the bus routes and constructions happening along the way.

The codes are developed using different programming languages like C#, Python and Javascript abd the cloud system that is used is completely Azure, where a number of Azure services were used like Azure SQL Databases, Azure Function Apps, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Maps. We also used Microsoft SQL to write procedures to collect the data for our API's.

Everything that we've done so far has been uploaded in the three directories.

Optimisation was unsuccessful due to the lack of time and due to inaccurate locations that we've obtained from the construction sites.
